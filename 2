1. Each proces has a current directory, and all filenames are assumed to 
   start with the name of that directory, unless they begin with a slash(/)

2. Directorie is also ordinary file. They can be read but not created or written.

3. list files and disc usage: du -a

4. find a file by its name: 
   (1). du -a | grep filename
   (2). find path -name filename

5. user information: /etc/passwd, user has user id and group id.

6. file permission: -/d(-: ordinary file, d: directory)rwx/s(read, write, execute/set uid, file owner)
   r--(group users, only read)r--(other users, only read)
   set uid: when executing, the program is given the permission corresponding to the file owner.

7. remove file: rm -f(force to remove without question) 

8. change permissions of file: chmod 676 file(is rw-rwxrw-), chmor +x file(allow to execute),
   chmod -w file(disallow to write)
   (prevent from removing a file: not change the permission of file, but disallow write permission of the directory)

9. file: name, inode, content. Every file has unique inode(i-number) and content, but can have different names.
   Filename is a link to inode and content. rm will not remove file unless this filename is the last link to the file.
   
   make a new link to a file: ln old-file-name new-file-name 
   When change file content with link a(filename a), open with link b(filename b) will reflect the change.
   
   copy file: cp old-file-name new-file-name
   move(rename file): mv old-file-name new-file-name 
   copy/move files into one directory: cp/mv f1 f2 ... directory

   each terminal associates with a file in /dev/...(command tty finds it out)
   discard the output: ... >/dev/null
